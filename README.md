# Prior-and-Posterior-probabilties

There are five types of bags of candies. Each bag has an infinite amount of candies. We have one of those bags, and we are picking candies out of it. We don't know what type of bag we have, so we want to figure out the probability of each type based on the candies that we have picked.

The five possible hypotheses for our bag are:

h1 (prior: 10%): This type of bag contains 100% cherry candies.
h2 (prior: 20%): This type of bag contains 75% cherry candies and 25% lime candies.
h3 (prior: 40%): This type of bag contains 50% cherry candies and 50% lime candies.
h4 (prior: 20%): This type of bag contains 25% cherry candies and 75% lime candies.
h5 (prior: 10%): This type of bag contains 100% lime candies.
Given the following sequences of observations show how the Posterior probabilties change.

a. CCCCCL
b. CLCLCL
c. CCCLLL
